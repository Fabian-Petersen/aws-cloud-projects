# ☁️ AWS Cloud Projects Repository

Welcome to my cloud projects repository!!<br>
This is a collection of hands-on cloud computing projects where i explore and implement various cloud technologies with a focus on AWS and Terraform (Infrastructure as Code).<br>

As a passionate DevOps Engineer and AWS enthusiast, I aim to expand my cloud expertise and document my learning through these projects.

## 🎯 Mission

To build, deploy, and manage scalable, secure, and cost-effective cloud applications using AWS services and Terraform infrastructure as code.

## 🌍 Vision

To continuously grow as a Cloud Engineer, mastering AWS, DevOps automation, and modern infrastructure design — while sharing practical, real-world implementations.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, CloudFront, etc.)
- Infrastructure and Code: Terraform
- CI/CD & Automation: GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline
- Monitoring & Compliance: CloudWatch, AWS Config
- Security:
- Languages: Python, TypeScript, Bash

## 📘 Repository Goals
